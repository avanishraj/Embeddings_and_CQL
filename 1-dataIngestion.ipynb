The traditional \\nreactive approach —where diseases are treated only after they have \\nprogressed —has led to numerous issues that affect both patients and healthcare \\nproviders:  \\n1. Delayed Diagnosis : Many serious health conditions, such as heart disease, \\ncancer, and diabetes, go undetected until they have advanced, resulting in \\nmore complex and costly treatments. Early detection remains a challenge \\nin the current healthcare landscape.  \\n2. High Healthcare Costs : The expense of treating advanced -stage illnesses \\nis significantly higher than prevention and early intervention. This reactive \\napproach burdens healthcare systems, patients, and insurance providers, \\nmaking treatment inaccessible for many.  \\n3. Overburdened Healthcare Providers : Hospitals and clinics are \\noverwhelmed by patients who need urgent care for advanced diseases. The \\nlimited capacity for early intervention means that healthcare workers face \\nincreased workloads, longer wait times, and reduced patient satisfaction.  \\n4. Limited Access to Personalized Care : Healthcare services are often \\ngeneric, without considering the individual’s unique health profile, \\nlifestyle, or medical history. Patients receive treatment that is not tailored \\nto their specific needs, leading to suboptimal outcomes.  \\n5. Lack of Patient Control and Choice : Patients today have very little \\ncontrol over the selection of healthcare services, particularly when it comes \\nto choosing labs for diagnostic tests. They are unable to easily compare \\nprices or distances to lab centres , often resulting in inconvenient and costly \\ndecisions. No platform currently provides a streamlined way for users to \\nmake informed decisions based on price  and distance , which can greatly \\nenhance accessibility and affordability for patients.  '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Avanish_Minor_Project_Synopsis.pdf', 'page': 3}, page_content=\"6. Inefficient Health Report Access : After undergoing medical tests, \\npatients often need to revisit labs or hospitals to obtain their results, causing \\nunnecessary delays and inconvenience. The lack of seamless, digital access \\nto health records hinders patients from efficiently monitoring th eir health. \\nNo current platform offers users the ability to analyze and compare their \\nprevious health reports with current results , preventing them from \\ntracking progress or identifying potential health risks early on.  \\n7. Poor Health Outcomes : These systemic issues lead to poor health \\noutcomes, as patients are often treated too late or inefficiently, resulting in \\nhigher mortality rates, chronic suffering, and decreased quality of life.  \\n \\n \\nOBJECTIVE: - The main objective that the health app will focus on is to \\ntransform a patient's experience by dissolving the urgent problems of the \\nexisting healthcare system. For example, this application will:  \\n1. Facilitate Early Detection : Enable its users to find and schedule \\nappointments at nearby labs and hospitals, allowing proactive health \\nchecks, and diagnosis of possible health issues at the right time.  \\n2. Healthcare Cost Reduction:  Provide transparent pricing and distance \\ninformation for diagnostic tests so that patients make informed choices \\nbased on considerations of affordability and accessibility.  \\n3. Tailor Patient Care:  Allow users to compare present health reports with \\nhistorical data to be more personally involved in the care of one's health.  \\n4. Empowering Patient Control : Enable patients to track and monitor their \\nmedical history, thus giving greater control over one's journey, and \\nencouraging the patient to take more interest in their care.  \\n5. Health Outcomes:  Eventually, there will be reduced prevalence of \\nadvanced disease which leads to healthier outcomes and improved quality \\nof life through preventive care, timely interventions, and education.  \\nAchieving these goals will make the app a contributing factor toward an \\nefficient, patient -centered health care system that focuses on early \\nintervention and personalized care and ultimately leads to improved quality \\nof life for users . \"),\n",

The paper introduced a new deep learning architecture known as the transformer, based on the attention mechanism proposed in 2014 by Bahdanau et al.[4] It is considered a foundational[5] paper in modern artificial intelligence, as the transformer approach has become the main architecture of large language models like those based on GPT.[6][7] At the time, the focus of the research was on improving Seq2seq techniques for machine translation, but the authors go further in the paper, foreseeing the technique\\'s potential for other tasks like question answering and what is now known as multimodal Generative AI.[1]\\nThe paper\\'s title is a reference to the song \"All You Need Is Love\" by the Beatles.[8] The name \"Transformer\" was picked because Uszkoreit liked the sound of that word.[9]\\nAn early design document was titled \"Transformers: Iterative Self-Attention and Processing for Various Tasks\", and included an illustration of six characters from the Transformers animated show. The team was named Team Transformer.[8]\\nSome early examples that the team tried their Transformer architecture on included English-to-German translation, generating Wikipedia articles on \"The Transformer\", and parsing. These convinced the team that the Transformer is a general purpose language model, and not just good for translation.[9]\\nAs of 2024,[update] the paper has been cited more than 100,000 times.[10]\\nFor their 100M-parameter Transformer model, they suggested learning rate should be linearly scaled up from 0 to maximal value for the first part of the training (i.e. 2% of the total number of training steps), and to use dropout, to stabilize training.\\n\\n\\nAuthors[edit]\\nThe authors of the paper are: Ashish Vaswani, Noam Shazeer, Niki Parmar, Jakob Uszkoreit, Llion Jones, Aidan Gomez, Lukasz Kaiser, and Illia Polosukhin. All eight authors were \"equal contributors\" to the paper; the listed order was randomized. The Wired article highlights the group\\'s diversity:[8]\\n\\n\\nSix of the eight authors were born outside the United States; the other two are children of two green-card-carrying Germans who were temporarily in California and a first-generation American whose family had fled persecution, respectively.\\n\\n\\nBy 2023, all eight authors had left Google and founded their own AI start-ups (except Łukasz Kaiser, who joined OpenAI).[8][10]\\n\\nHistorical context[edit]\\nMain articles: Transformer (deep learning architecture) §\\xa0History, and Seq2seq §\\xa0History\\nSee also: Timeline of machine learning\\n Predecessors[edit]\\nFor many years, sequence modelling and generation was done by using plain recurrent neural networks (RNNs). A well-cited early example was the Elman network (1990). In theory, the information from one token can propagate arbitrarily far down the sequence, but in practice the vanishing-gradient problem leaves the model\\'s state at the end of a long sentence without precise, extractable information about preceding tokens.\\nA key breakthrough was LSTM (1995),[note 1] a RNN which used various innovations to overcome the vanishing gradient problem, allowing efficient learning of long-sequence modelling. One key innovation was the use of an attention mechanism which used neurons that multiply the outputs of other neurons, so-called multiplicative units.[11] Neural networks using multiplicative units were later called sigma-pi networks[12] or higher-order networks.[13] LSTM became the standard architecture for long sequence modelling until the 2017 publication of Transformers.\\nHowever, LSTM still used sequential processing, like most other RNNs.[note 2] Specifically, RNNs operate one token at a time from first to last; they cannot operate in parallel over all tokens in a sequence. \\nModern Transformers overcome this problem, but unlike RNNs, they require computation time that is quadratic in the size of the context window.  The linearly scaling fast weight controller (1992) learns  to compute a  weight matrix for further processing depending on the input.[14] One of its two networks has  \"fast weights\" or \"dynamic links\" (1981).[15][16][17] A slow neural network learns by gradient descent to generate keys and values for computing the weight changes of the fast neural network which computes answers to queries.[14] This was later shown to be equivalent to the unnormalized linear Transformer.[18][19]\\n\\n Attention with seq2seq[edit]\\nMain article: Seq2seq §\\xa0History\\nThe idea of encoder-decoder sequence transduction had been developed in the early 2010s (see [20][21] for previous papers). The papers most commonly cited as the originators that produced seq2seq are two concurrently published papers from 2014.[20][21]\\n(Sutskever et al, 2014) [21] was a 380M-parameter model for machine translation using two long short-term memory (LSTM). The architecture consists of two parts. The encoder is an LSTM that takes in a sequence of tokens and turns it into a vector. The decoder is another LSTM that converts the vector into a sequence of tokens. Similarly, (Cho et al, 2014)[20] was 130M-parameter model that used gated recurrent units (GRU) instead of LSTM. Later research showed that GRUs are neither better nor worse than LSTMs for seq2seq.[22][23]\\nThese early seq2seq models had no attention mechanism, and the state vector is accessible only after the last word of the source text was processed. Although in theory such a vector retains the information about the whole original sentence, in practice the information is poorly preserved, since the input is processed sequentially by one recurrent network into a fixed-size output vector, which was then processed by another recurrent network into an output. If the input is long, then the output vector would not be able to contain all relevant information, and the output quality degrades. As evidence, reversing the input sentence improved seq2seq translation.[24]\\n(Bahdanau et al, 2014)[25] introduced an attention mechanism to seq2seq for machine translation to solve the bottleneck problem (of fixed-size output vector), allowing the model to process long-distance dependencies more easily. They called their model RNNsearch, as it \"emulates searching through a source sentence during decoding a translation\".\\n(Luong et al, 2015)[26] compared the relative performance of global (that of (Bahdanau et al, 2014)) and local (sliding window) attention model architectures for machine translation, and found that a mixed attention architecture had higher quality than global attention, while the use of a local attention architecture reduced translation time.\\nIn 2016, Google Translate was revamped to Google Neural Machine Translation, which replaced the previous model based on statistical machine translation. The new model was a seq2seq model where the encoder and the decoder were both 8 layers of bidirectional LSTM.[27] It took nine months to develop, and it achieved a higher level of performance than the statistical approach, which took ten years to develop.[28] In the same year, self-attention avant la lettre, originally called intra-attention or intra-sentence attention, was proposed for LSTMs.[29][30]\\n\\n Parallelizing attention[edit]\\nMain article: Attention (machine learning) §\\xa0History\\nSeq2seq models with attention (including self-attention) still suffered from the same issue with recurrent networks, which is that they are hard to parallelize, which prevented them to be accelerated on GPUs. In 2016, decomposable attention applied a self-attention mechanism to feedforward networks, which are easy to parallelize, and achieved SOTA result in textual entailment with an order of magnitude less parameters than LSTMs.[31] One of its authors, Jakob Uszkoreit, suspected that attention without recurrence is sufficient for language translation, thus the title \"attention is all you need\".[32] That hypothesis was against conventional wisdom of the time, and even his father, a well-known computational linguist, was skeptical.[32]\\nIn 2017, the original (100M-sized) encoder-decoder transformer model was proposed in the \"Attention is all you need\" paper. At the time, the focus of the research was on improving seq2seq for machine translation, by removing its recurrence to process all tokens in parallel, but preserving its dot-product attention mechanism to keep its text processing performance.[30] Its parallelizability was an important factor to its widespread use in large neural networks.[33]\\n\\n\\n AI boom era[edit]\\nAlready in spring 2017, even before the \"Attention is all you need\" preprint was published, one of the co-authors applied the \"decoder-only\" variation of the architecture to generate fictitious Wikipedia articles.[34] Transformer architecture is now used in many generative models that contribute to the ongoing AI boom.\\nIn language modelling, ELMo (2018) was a bi-directional LSTM that produces contextualized word embeddings, improving upon the line of research from bag of words and word2vec. It was followed by BERT (2018), an encoder-only Transformer model.[35] In 2019 October, Google started using BERT to process search queries.[36] In 2020, Google Translate replaced the previous RNN-encoder–RNN-decoder model by a Transformer-encoder–RNN-decoder model.[37]\\nStarting in 2018, the OpenAI GPT series of decoder-only Transformers became state of the art in natural language generation. In 2022, a chatbot based on GPT-3, ChatGPT, became unexpectedly popular,[38] triggering a boom around large language models.[39][40]\\nSince 2020, Transformers have been applied in modalities beyond text, including the vision transformer,[41] speech recognition,[42] robotics,[43] and multimodal.[44] The vision transformer, in turn, stimulated new developments in convolutional neural networks.[45] Image and video generators like DALL-E (2021), Stable Diffusion 3 (2024),[46] and Sora (2024), are based on the Transformer architecture.\\n\\nNotes[edit]\\n\\n\\n^ Gated recurrent units (2014) further reduced its complexity.\\n\\n^ Some architectures, such as RWKV or state space models, avoid the issue.\\n\\n\\nReferences[edit]\\n\\n\\n^ a b Vaswani, Ashish; Shazeer, Noam; Parmar, Niki; Uszkoreit, Jakob; Jones, Llion; Gomez, Aidan N; Kaiser, Łukasz; Polosukhin, Illia (2017). \"Attention is All you Need\" (PDF).

The results of this test can identify certain genetic diseases and can determine approximate risks for cardiovascular disease, certain forms of pancreatitis, and other diseases.\\nLipid panels are usually ordered as part of a physical exam, along with other panels such as the complete blood count (CBC) and basic metabolic panel (BMP).\\n\\n\\n== Components ==\\nA lipid profile report typically includes:\\n\\nLow-density lipoprotein (LDL)\\nHigh-density lipoprotein (HDL)\\nTotal triglycerides\\nTotal cholesterol\\nLDL is not usually actually measured, but calculated from the other three using the Friedewald equation. A laboratory can optionally calculate the two extra values from the report:\\n\\nVery low-density lipoprotein (VLDL)\\nCholesterol:HDL ratio\\n\\n\\n== Procedure and indication ==\\nRecommendations for cholesterol testing come from the Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III guidelines, and are based on many large clinical studies, such as the Framingham Heart Study.\\nFor healthy adults with no cardiovascular risk factors, the ATP III guidelines recommend screening once every five years. A lipid profile may also be ordered at regular intervals to evaluate the success of lipid-lowering drugs such as statins.\\nIn the pediatric and adolescent population, lipid testing is not routinely performed. However, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) recommend that children aged 9–11 be screened once for severe cholesterol abnormalities. This screening can be valuable to detect genetic diseases such as familial hypercholesterolemia that can be lethal if not treated early.\\nTraditionally, most laboratories have required patients to fast for 9–12 hours before screening. However, studies have questioned the utility of fasting before lipid panels, and some diagnostic labs routinely accept non-fasting samples.\\n\\n\\n== Methods ==\\n\\n\\n=== Friedewald ===\\nTypically the laboratory measures only three quantities: total cholesterol; HDL; Triglycerides. A typical procedure used by NHANES 2004 uses the following measurement methods:\\n\\nTotal cholesterol is measured using a mixture of enzymes. First an esterase converts cholesterol esters into cholesterol and free fatty acid. Then an oxidase oxidizes the cholesterol, producing a H2O2 side-product that changes the color of a dye. The amount of oxidation can be precisely quantified by light absorbance at 500 nm.\\nTriglyceride concentration is also measured using an enzyme mixture. A lipase releases glycerol from the molecules, which gets oxidized by another enzyme while producing H2O2. The same color-change follows.\\nHDL is measured in two steps. First a special reagent is added to the serum that binds apoB-containing lipoprotein particles, shielding them from the enzymes in the next step. Then a mixture of PEGylated enzymes is added with dye. The chemical reaction is the same as the total cholesterol measurement, except that the enzymes are blocked from acting on non-HDL lipoproteins by the reagent and their own PEG tails.\\nFrom these three data LDL may be calculated. According to Friedewald's equation:\\n\\n[LDL]  =  [Total cholesterol] − [HDL] − \\u2060 [Triglycerides] /5\\u2060\\nOther calculations of LDL from those same three data have been proposed which yield some significantly different results.\\nVLDL can be defined as the total cholesterol that is neither HDL nor LDL. With that definition, Friedewald's equation yields:\\n\\n[VLDL]  =  \\u2060 [Triglycerides] /5\\u2060\\nThe alternative calculations mentioned above may yield significantly different values for VLDL.\\nThe Friedewald method is reasonably reliable for the majority of patients, but is notably inaccurate in patients with hypertriglyceridemia (> 400 mg/dL or 4.5 mmol/L). It also underestimates LDL-C in patients with low LDL-C (< 25 mg/dL or 0.6 mmol/L). It does not take into account intermediate-density lipoprot\"),\n",

Lipids may be broadly defined as hydrophobic or amphipathic small molecules that originate entirely or in part from two distinct types of biochemical subunits or \"building blocks\": ketoacyl and isoprene groups. The\\nhuge structural diversity found in lipids arises from the biosynthesis of various combinations of these building blocks. For example, glycerophospholipids are composed of a glycerol backbone linked to one of approximately 10 possible headgroups and also to 2 fatty acyl/alkyl chains, which in turn may have 30 or more different molecular structures. In practice, not all possible permutations are detected experimentally, due to chain preferences depending on the cell type and also to detection limits - nevertheless several hundred distinct glycerophospholipid molecular species have been detected in mammalian cells.\\nPlant chloroplast thylakoid membranes however, have unique lipid composition as they are deficient in phospholipids. Also, their largest constituent, monogalactosyl diglyceride or MGDG, does not form aqueous bilayers. Nevertheless, dynamic studies reveal a normal lipid bilayer organisation in thylakoid membranes.\\n\\n\\n== Experimental techniques ='),\n",

It is a member of the pentraxin family of proteins. It is not related to C-peptide (insulin) or protein C (blood coagulation). C-reactive protein was the first pattern recognition receptor (PRR) to be identified.\\n\\n\\n== History and etymology ==\\nDiscovered by Tillett and Francis in 1930, it was initially thought that CRP might be a pathogenic secretion since it was elevated in a variety of illnesses, including cancer. The later discovery of hepatic synthesis (made in the liver) demonstrated that it is a native protein. Initially, CRP was measured using the quellung reaction which gave a positive or a negative result. More precise methods nowadays use dynamic light scattering after reaction with CRP-specific antibodies.\\nCRP was so named because it was first identified as a substance in the serum of patients with acute inflammation that reacted with the cell wall  polysaccharide (C-polysaccharide) of pneumococcus.\\n\\n\\n== Genetics and structure ==\\nIt is a member of the small pentraxins family (also known as short pentraxins). The polypeptide encoded by this gene has 224 amino acids. The full-length polypeptide is not present in the body in significant quantities due to signal peptide, which is removed by signal peptidase before translation is completed. The complete protein, composed of five monomers, has a total mass of approximately 120,000 Da.  In serum, it assembles into stable pentameric structure with a discoid shape.\\n\\n\\n== Function ==\\nCRP binds to the phosphocholine expressed on the surface of bacterial cells such as pneumococcus bacteria. This activates the complement system, promoting phagocytosis by macrophages, which clears necrotic and apoptotic cells and bacteria. With this mechanism, CRP also binds to ischemic/hypoxic cells, which could regenerate with more time. However, the binding of CRP causes them to be disposed of prematurely. CRP is a prehistoric antibody and binds to the Fc-gamma receptor IIa, to which antibodies also bind. In addition, CRP activates the classical complement pathway via C1q binding. CRP thus forms immune complexes in the same way as IgG antibodies.\\nThis so-called acute phase response occurs as a result of increasing concentrations of interleukin-6 (IL-6), which is produced by macrophages as well as adipocytes in response to a wide range of acute and chronic inflammatory conditions such as bacterial, viral, or fungal infections; rheumatic and other inflammatory diseases; malignancy; and tissue injury and necrosis. These conditions cause release of IL-6 and other cytokines that trigger the synthesis of CRP and fibrinogen by the liver.\\nCRP binds to phosphocholine on micro-organisms. It is thought to assist in complement binding to foreign and damaged cells and enhances phagocytosis by macrophages (opsonin-mediated phagocytosis), which express a receptor for CRP. It plays a role in innate immunity as an early defense system against infections.\\n\\n\\n== Serum levels ==\\n\\n\\n=== Measurement methods ===\\nTraditional CRP measurement only detected CRP in the range of 10 to 1,000 mg/L, whereas high sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP) detects CRP in the range of 0.5 to 10 mg/L. hs-CRP can detect cardiovascular disease risk when in excess of 3 mg/L, whereas below 1 mg/L would be low risk. Traditional CRP measurement is faster and less costly than hs-CRP, and can be adequate for some applications, such as monitoring hemodialysis patients. Current i'),\n",

Higher doses were more efficacious in improving the lipid profile of patients with hypercholesterolemia than milligram-equivalent doses of atorvastatin and milligram-equivalent or higher doses of simvastatin and pravastatin.\\nMeta-analysis showed that rosuvastatin is able to modestly increase levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol as well, as with other statins.

Unsaturated fats tend to have a lower melting point than saturated analogues; as a result, they are often liquid at room temperature.\\n\\n\\n== Chemical structure ==\\n\\nThe three fatty acids substituents can be the same, but they are usually different.  Many triglycerides are known because many fatty acids are known. The chain lengths of the fatty acid groups vary in naturally occurring triglycerides,  Those containing 16, 18, or 20 carbon atoms are defined as long-chain triglycerides, while medium-chain triglycerides contain shorter fatty acids. Animals synthesize even-numbered fatty acids, but bacteria possess the ability to synthesise odd- and branched-chain fatty acids. As a result, ruminant animal fat contains odd-numbered fatty acids, such as 15, due to the action of bacteria in the rumen.  Many fatty acids are unsaturated; some are polyunsaturated (e.g., those derived from linoleic acid).\\nMost natural fats contain a complex mixture of individual triglycerides. Because of their heterogeneity, they melt over a broad range of temperatures. Cocoa butter is unusual in that it is composed of only a few triglycerides, derived from palmitic, oleic, and stearic acids in the 1-, 2-, and 3-positions of glycerol, respectively.\\nThe simplest triglycerides are those where the three fatty acids are identical. Their names indicate the fatty acid: stearin derived from stearic acid, triolein derived from oleic acid, palmitin derived from palmitic acid, etc.  These compounds can be obtained in three crystalline forms (polymorphs): α, β, and β′, the three forms differing in their melting points.\\nA triglyceride containing different fatty acids is known as a mixed triglyceride. These are more common in nature.\\nIf the first and third fatty acids on the glycerol differ, then the mixed triglyceride is chiral.\\n\\n\\n== Physical properties ==\\nTriglycerides are colorless, although degraded samples can appear yellowish.  Stearin, a simple, saturated, symmetrical triglyceride, is a solid near room temperature, but most examples are oils.  Their density is near 0.-0.9 g/cm3.\\n\\n\\n== Biosynthesis ==\\nTriglycerides are tri-esters derived from the condensation reaction of glycerol with three fatty acids. Their formation can be summarised by the following overall equation:\\n\\nCH(OH)(CH2OH)2  +  RCOOH  +  R\\'COOH  +  R\"COOH   →   RC(O)OCH2−CH(OC(O)R\\')−CH2C(O)OR\"  +  3H2O\\nIn nature, the formation of triglycerides is not random; rather, specific fatty acids are selectively condensed with the hydroxyl functional groups of glycerol. Animal fats typically have unsaturated fatty acid residues on carbon atoms 1 and 3. Extreme examples of non-random fats are cocoa butter (mentioned above) and lard, which contains about 20% triglyceride with palmitic acid on carbon 2 and oleic acid on carbons 1 and 3. An early step in the biosynthesis is the formation of the glycerol-1-phosphate:\\n\\nCH(OH)(CH2OH)2  +  H2PO−4   →   HOCH2−CH(OH)−CH2−OPO3H−  +  H2O\\nThe three oxygen atoms in this phosphate ester are differentiated, setting the stage for regiospecific formation of triglycerides, as the diol reacts selectively with coenzyme-A derivatives of the fatty acids, RC(O)S–CoA:\\n\\nHOCH2−CH(OH)−CH2−OPO3H−  +  RC(O)S−CoA  +  R\\'C(O)S−CoA   →   RC(O)O−CH2−CH(−OC(O)R\\')−CH2−OPO3H−  +  2HS−CoA\\nThe phosphate ester linkage is then hydrolysed to make way for the introduction of a third fatty acid es'),\n",

LDL delivers fat molecules to cells. LDL has been associated with the progression of atherosclerosis.\\n\\n\\n== Overview ==\\nLipoproteins transfer lipids (fats) around the body in the extracellular fluid, making fats available to body cells for receptor-mediated endocytosis. Lipoproteins are complex particles composed of multiple proteins, typically 80–100 proteins per particle (organized by a single apolipoprotein B for LDL and the larger particles). A single LDL particle is about 220–275 angstroms in diameter, typically transporting 3,000 to 6,000 fat molecules per particle, and varying in size according to the number and mix of fat molecules contained within. The lipids carried include all fat molecules with cholesterol, phospholipids, and triglycerides dominant; amounts of each vary considerably.\\nA good clinical interpretation of blood lipid levels is that high LDL, in combination with a high amount of triglycerides, which indicates a high likelihood of the LDL being oxidised, is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular diseases.\\n\\n\\n== Biochemistry ==\\n\\n\\n=== Structure ===\\nEach native LDL particle enables emulsification, i.e. surrounding the fatty acids being carried, enabling these fats to move around the body within the water outside cells. Each particle contains a single apolipoprotein B-100 molecule (Apo B-100, a protein that has 4536 amino acid residues and a mass of 514 kDa), along with 80 to 100 additional ancillary proteins. Each LDL has a highly hydrophobic core consisting of polyunsaturated fatty acid known as linoleate and hundreds to thousands (about 1500 commonly cited as an average) of esterified and unesterified cholesterol molecules. This core also carries varying numbers of triglycerides and other fats and is surrounded by a shell of phospholipids and unesterified cholesterol, as well as the single copy of Apo B-100. LDL particles are approximately 22 nm (0.00000087 in.) to 27.5 nm in diameter and have a mass of about 3 million daltons. Since LDL particles contain a variable and changing number of fatty acid molecules, there is a distribution of LDL particle mass and size. Determining the structure of LDL has been a tough task because of its heterogeneous structure. However, the structure of LDL at human body temperature in native condition, with a resolution of about 16 Angstroms using cryogenic electron microscopy, has been described in 2011.\\n\\n\\n== Physiology ==\\nLDL particles are formed when triglycerides are removed from VLDL by the lipoprotein lipase enzyme (LPL) and they become smaller and denser (i.e. fewer fat molecules with same protein transport shell), containing a higher proportion of cholesterol esters.\\n\\n\\n=== Transport into the cell ===\\nWhen a cell requires additional cholesterol (beyond its current internal HMGCoA production pathway), it synthesizes the necessary LDL receptors as well as PCSK9, a proprotein convertase that marks the LDL receptor for degradation. LDL receptors are inserted into the plasma membrane and diffuse freely until they associate with clathrin-coated pits. When LDL receptors bind LDL particles in the bloodstream, the clathrin-coated pits are endocytosed into the cell.\\nVesicles containing LDL receptors bound to LDL are delivered to the endosome. In the presence of low pH, such as that found in the endosome, LDL receptors undergo a conformation change, releasing LDL. LDL is then shipped to the lysosome, where cholesterol esters in the LDL are hydrolysed. LDL receptors are typically returned to the plasma membrane, where they repeat this cycle.

While most cells are capable of synthesizing it, the majority of cholesterol is ingested or synthesized by hepatocytes and transported in the blood to peripheral cells. The levels of cholesterol in peripheral tissues is dictated by a balance of uptake and export. Under normal conditions, brain cholesterol is separate from peripheral cholesterol, i.e., the dietary and hepatic cholesterol do not cross the blood brain barrier. Rather, astrocytes produce and distribute cholesterol in the brain.\\nDe novo synthesis, both in astrocytes and hepatocytes, occurs by a complex 37-step process. This begins with the mevalonate or HMG-CoA reductase pathway, the target of statin drugs, which encompasses the first 18 steps. This is followed by 19 additional steps to convert the resulting lanosterol into cholesterol. A human male weighing 68 kg (150 lb) normally synthesizes about 1 gram (1,000 mg) of cholesterol per day, and his body contains about 35 g, mostly contained within the cell membranes.\\nTypical daily cholesterol dietary intake for a man in the United States is 307 mg. Most ingested cholesterol is esterified, which causes it to be poorly absorbed by the gut. The body also compensates for absorption of ingested cholesterol by reducing its own cholesterol synthesis. For these reasons, cholesterol in food, seven to ten hours after ingestion, has little, if any effect on concentrations of cholesterol in the blood. Surprisingly, in rats, blood cholesterol is inversely correlated with cholesterol consumption. The more cholesterol a rat eats the lower the blood cholesterol. During the first seven hours after ingestion of cholesterol, as absorbed fats are being distributed around the body within extracellular water by the various lipoproteins (which transport all fats in the water outside cells), the concentrations increase.\\nPlants make cholesterol in very small amounts. In larger quantities they produce phytosterols, chemically similar substances which can compete with cholesterol for reabsorption in the intestinal tract, thus potentially reducing cholesterol reabsorption. When intestinal lining cells absorb phytosterols, in place of cholesterol, they usually excrete the phytosterol molecules back into the GI tract, an important protective mechanism. The intake of naturally occurring phytosterols, which encompass plant sterols and stanols, ranges between ≈200–300 mg/day depending on eating habits. Specially designed vegetarian experimental diets have been produced yielding upwards of 700 mg/day.\\n\\n\\n=== Function ===\\n\\n\\n==== Membranes ====\\nCholesterol is present in varying degrees in all animal cell membranes, but is absent in prokaryotes.

Anna-Britt Agnsäter, chief of the test kitchen for Kooperativa Förbundet (a cooperative Swedish retail chain), held a lecture the next year on how to illustrate these food groups. Attendee Fjalar Clemes suggested a triangle displaying basic foods at the base. Agnsäter developed the idea into the first food pyramid, which was introduced to the public in 1974 in KF\\'s Vi magazine. The pyramid was divided into basic foods at the base, including milk, cheese, margarine, bread, cereals and potato; a large section of supplemental vegetables and fruit; and an apex of supplemental meat, fish and egg. The pyramid competed with the National Board\\'s \"dietary circle\", which KF saw as problematic for resembling a cake divided into seven slices, and for not indicating how much of each food should be eaten. While the Board distanced itself from the pyramid, KF continued to promote it.\\nFood pyramids were developed in other Scandinavian countries, as well as West Germany, Japan and Sri Lanka.

The structure is similar in some respects to the USDA food pyramid, but there are clear distinctions between types of fats, and a more dramatic distinction where carbohydrates are categorized on the basis of free sugars versus sugars in their natural form. Some food substances are singled out due to the impact on the target issues that the \"pyramid\" is meant to address. In a later revision, however, some recommendations are omitted as they automatically follow other recommendations while other sub-categories are added. The reports quoted here explain that where there is no stated lower limit in the table below, there is no requirement for that nutrient in the diet.\\n\\nAll percentages are percentages of calories, not of weight or volume. To understand why, consider the determination of an amount of \"10% free sugar\" to include in a day\\'s worth of calories. For the same amount of calories, free sugars take up less volume and weight, being refined and extracted from the competing carbohydrates in their natural form. In a similar manner, all the items are in competition for various categories of calories.\\nThe representation as a pyramid is not precise, and involves variations due to the alternative percentages of different elements, but the main sections can be represented.\\n\\n\\n== USDA food pyramid ==\\n\\n\\n=== History ===\\n\\nThe USDA food pyramid was created in 1992 and divided into six horizontal sections containing depictions of foods from each section\\'s food group.

The human body can produce the fat it requires from other food ingredients, except for a few essential fatty acids that must be included in the diet. Dietary fats are also the carriers of some flavor and aroma ingredients and vitamins that are not water-soluble.\\n\\n\\n== Biological importance ==\\nIn humans and many animals, fats serve both as energy sources and as stores for energy in excess of what the body needs immediately. Each gram of fat when burned or metabolized releases about nine food calories (37 kJ = 8.8 kcal).\\nFats are also sources of essential fatty acids, an important dietary requirement. Vitamins A, D, E, and K are fat-soluble, meaning they can only be digested, absorbed, and transported in conjunction with fats.\\nFats play a vital role in maintaining healthy skin and hair, insulating body organs against shock, maintaining body temperature, and promoting healthy cell function. Fat also serves as a useful buffer against a host of diseases. When a particular substance, whether chemical or biotic, reaches unsafe levels in the bloodstream, the body can effectively dilute—or at least maintain equilibrium of—the offending substances by storing it in new fat tissue. This helps to protect vital organs, until such time as the offending substances can be metabolized or removed from the body by such means as excretion, urination, accidental or intentional bloodletting, sebum excretion, and hair growth.\\n\\n\\n=== Adipose tissue ===\\n\\nIn animals, adipose tissue, or fatty tissue is the body's means of storing metabolic energy over extended periods of time. Adipocytes (fat cells) store fat derived from the diet and from liver metabolism. Under energy stress these cells may degrade their stored fat to supply fatty acids and also glycerol to the circulation. These metabolic activities are regulated by several hormones (e.g., insulin, glucagon and epinephrine). Adipose tissue also secretes the hormone leptin.\\n\\n\\n== Production and processing ==\\nA variety of chemical and physical techniques are used for the production and processing of fats, both industrially and in cottage or home settings. They include:\\n\\nPressing to extract liquid fats from fruits, seeds, or algae, e.g. olive oil from olives\\nSolvent extraction using solvents like hexane or supercritical carbon dioxide\\nRendering, the melting of fat in adipose tissue, e.g. to produce tallow, lard, fish oil, and whale oil\\nChurning of milk to produce butter\\nHydrogenation to increase the degree of saturation of the fatty acids\\nInteresterification, the rearrangement of fatty acids across different triglycerides\\nWinterization to remove oil components wi\"),\n",

The most common use of spironolactone is in the treatment of heart failure. On its own, spironolactone is only a weak diuretic because it primarily targets the distal nephron (collecting tubule), where only small amounts of sodium are reabsorbed, but it can be combined with other diuretics to increase efficacy. The classification of spironolactone as a \"potassium-sparing diuretic\" has been described as obsolete. Spironolactone is also used to treat Bartter\\'s syndrome due to its ability to raise potassium levels.\\nSpironolactone has antiandrogenic activity. For this reason, it is used to treat a variety of dermatological conditions in which androgens play a role. Some of these uses include acne, seborrhea, hirsutism, and pattern hair loss in women. Spironolactone is used for the treatment of hirsutism in the United States. High doses of spironolactone, which are needed for considerable antiandrogenic effects, are not recommended for men due to the high risk of feminization and other side effects. Spironolactone can be used to treat symptoms of hyperandrogenism, such as due to polycystic ovary syndrome.\\n\\n\\n=== Heart failure ===\\nWhile loop diuretics remain first-line for most people with heart failure, spironolactone has shown to reduce both morbidity and mortality in numerous studies and remains an important agent for treating fluid retention, edema, and symptoms of heart failure. Current recommendations from the American Heart Association are to use spironolactone in patients with NYHA Class II-IV heart failure who have a left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 35%.\\nSpironolactone improves left ventricular diastolic function in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, however it has no effect on mortality and hospitalization.\\nDue to its antiandrogenic properties, spironolactone can cause effects associated with low androgen levels and hypogonadism in males. For this reason, men are typically not prescribed spironolactone for any longer than a short period of time, e.g., for an acute exacerbation of heart failure.

For example, it is stated that \"A prediction of the fluid mosaic model is that the two-dimensional long-range distribution of any integral protein in the plane of the membrane is essentially random.\" \\n\\n\\n== Chemical makeup ==\\n\\n\\n== Experimental evidence ==\\nThe fluid property of functional biological membranes had been determined through labeling experiments, x-ray diffraction, and calorimetry. These studies showed that integral membrane proteins diffuse at rates affected by the viscosity of the lipid bilayer in which they were embedded, and demonstrated that the molecules within the cell membrane are dynamic rather than static.\\nPrevious models of biological membranes included the Robertson Unit Membrane Model and the Davson-Danielli Tri-Layer model. These models had proteins present as sheets neighboring a lipid layer, rather than incorporated into the phospholipid bilayer. Other models described repeating, regular units of protein and lipid. These models were not well supported by microscopy and thermodynamic data, and did not accommodate evidence for dynamic membrane properties.\\n\\nAn important experiment that provided evidence supporting fluid and dynamic biological was performed by Frye and Edidin. They used Sendai virus to force human and mouse cells to fuse and form a heterokaryon. Using antibody staining, they were able to show that the mouse and human proteins remained segregated to separate halves of the heterokaryon a short time after cell fusion. However, the proteins eventually diffused and over time the border between the two halves was lost. Lowering the temperature slowed the rate of this diffusion by causing the membrane phospholipids to transition from a fluid to a gel phase. Singer and Nicolson rationalized the results of these experiments using their fluid mosaic model.\\nThe fluid mosaic model explains changes in structure and behavior of cell membranes under different temperatures, as well as the association of membrane proteins with the membranes. While Singer and Nicolson had substantial evidence drawn from multiple subfields to support their model, recent advances in fluorescence microscopy and structural biology have validated the fluid mosaic nature of cell membranes.\\n\\n\\n== Subsequent developments ==\\n\\n\\n=== Membrane asymmetry ===\\nAdditionally, the two leaflets of biological membranes are asymmetric and divided into subdomains composed of specific proteins or lipids, allowing spatial segregation of biological processes associated with membranes. Cholesterol and cholesterol-interacting proteins can concentrate into lipid rafts and constrain cell signaling processes to only these rafts. Another form of asymmetry was shown by the work of Mouritsen and Bloom in 1984, where they proposed a Mattress Model of lipid-protein interactions to address the biophysical evidence that the membrane can range in thickness and hydrophobicity of proteins.\\n\\n\\n=== Non-bilayer membranes ===\\nThe existence of non-bilayer lipid formations with important biological functions was confirmed subsequent to publication of the fluid mosaic model. These membrane structures may be useful when the cell needs to propagate a non bilayer form, which occurs during cell division and the formation of a gap junction.\\n\\n\\n=== Membrane curvature ===\\nThe membrane bilayer is not always flat.

This is done by using magnetic resonance Imaging (MRI) or CT scanning. The parameters of the MRI scanner are manipulated to show fat as bright (white) and lean tissue as dark.\\n\\nIndirect methods such as waist circumference are not suitable as individuals with an identical waist circumference can have vastly different levels of internal fat.

Bran is not the same as chaff, which is a coarser, scaly material surrounding the grain, but does not form part of the grain itself, and which is indigestible by humans.\\n\\n\\n== Composition ==\\nBran is particularly rich in dietary fiber and essential fatty acids, and contains significant quantities of starch, protein, vitamins, and dietary minerals. It is also a source of phytic acid, an antinutrient that prevents nutrient absorption.\\nThe high oil content of bran makes it subject to rancidification, one of the reasons that it is often separated from the grain before storage or further processing. Bran is often heat-treated to increase its shelf life.\\n\\n\\n== Rice bran ==\\nRice bran is a byproduct of the rice-milling process (the conversion of brown rice to white rice), and it contains various antioxidants. A major rice bran fraction contains 12%–13% oil and highly unsaponifiable components (4.3%). This fraction contains tocotrienols (a form of vitamin E), gamma-oryzanol, and beta-sitosterol; all these constituents may contribute to the lowering of the plasma levels of the various parameters of the lipid profile. Rice bran also contains a high level of dietary fiber (beta-glucan, pectin, and gum). It also contains ferulic acid, which is also a component of the structure of nonlignified cell walls. Some research suggests, though, inorganic arsenic is present at some level in rice bran. One study found the levels to be 20% higher than in contaminated drinking water.\\n\\n\\n== Uses ==\\n\\nBran is often used to enrich breads (notably muffins) and breakfast cereals, especially for the benefit of those wishing to increase their intake of dietary fiber. Bran may also be used for pickling (nukazuke) as in the tsukemono of Japan.   Rice bran in particular finds many uses in Japan, where it is known as nuka (糠; ぬか). Besides using it for pickling, Japanese people add it to the water when boiling bamboo shoots, and use it for dish washing. In Kitakyushu City, it is called jinda and used for stewing fish, such as sardines.\\nRice bran is stuck to the surface of commercial ice blocks to prevent them from melting. Bran oil may be also extracted for use by itself for industrial purposes (such as in the paint industry), or as a cooking oil, such as rice bran oil.\\n Wheat bran is useful as feed for poultry and other livestock, as part of a balanced ration with other inputs. Wheatings, a milling byproduct comprising mostly bran with some pieces of endosperm also left over, are included in this category.\\nBran was found to be the most successful slug deterrent by BBC's TV programme Gardeners' World.  It is a common substrate and food source used for feeder insects, such as mealworms and waxworms.

In the LAPC subgroup of the EPC trial, the rate of hot flashes with bicalutamide monotherapy was 13.1% (relative to 50.0% for castration).\\n\\n\\n=== Sexual dysfunction ===\\nBicalutamide may cause sexual dysfunction, including decreased sex drive and erectile dysfunction. However, the rates of these side effects with bicalutamide monotherapy are very low. In the EPC trial, at 7.4 years follow-up, the rates of decreased libido and impotence were only 3.6% and 9.3% in the 150 mg/day bicalutamide monotherapy group relative to 1.2% and 6.5% for placebo, respectively. Similarly, in the trials of 150 mg/day bicalutamide monotherapy for advanced prostate cancer, fewer than 10% of men reported decreased sex drive or reduced erectile function as a side effect. About two-thirds of men in these trials, who had advanced prostate cancer and were of almost invariably advanced age, maintained sexual interest, while sexual function was slightly reduced by 18%. Most men experience sexual dysfunction only moderately or not at all with bicalutamide monotherapy, and the same is true during monotherapy with other NSAAs. Bicalutamide monotherapy at a dosage of 50 mg/day had no effect on nocturnal erections in men with prostate cancer. The preservation of sexual desire and function with NSAA monotherapy may be related to testosterone metabolites such as estradiol and the 3α-androstanediol maintaining these functions rather than the androgen receptor or to bicalutamide and other NSAAs possibly incompletely blocking the androgen receptor in the brain.\\nSimilarly to in men, bicalutamide has been associated with minimal or no sexual dysfunction in women. A phase III clinical study of 50 mg/day bicalutamide in conjunction with a combined oral contraceptive in women with severe hirsutism due to polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) carefully assessed the side effect of decreased libido and found that the incidence with bicalutamide did not differ from the control group. Minimal rates of reduced sex drive have also been associated with the related NSAA flutamide. These findings are in accordance with the fact that women with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS) show normal sexual function in spite of complete loss of androgen receptor (AR) signaling. They are also in accordance with a variety of findings concerning testosterone levels and sexual function in premenopausal women, in which no change in parameters of sexual function, including libido, have been observed in association with'),\n",

A 2005 study based on a low-fat plant-based diet found that the average participant lost 13 pounds (5.9 kg) over fourteen weeks, and attributed the weight loss to the reduced energy density of the foods resulting from their low fat content and high fiber content, and the increased thermic effect. Nevertheless, these diets are not \"negative-calorie\" since they bear energy. Another study demonstrated that negative-calorie diets (NCDs) have the same efficacy to low-calorie diets (LCDs) in inducing weight loss when both of these diets are combined with exercise.\\nChewing gum has been speculated as a \"negative-calorie food\"; A study on chewing gum reported mastication burns roughly 11 kcal (46 kJ) per hour.

Turnip, rutabaga (swede), cabbage, Brussels sprouts, and mustard are related to rapeseed. Rapeseed belongs to the genus Brassica. Brassica oilseed varieties are some of the oldest plants cultivated by humanity, with documentation of its use in India 4,000 years ago, and use in China and Japan 2,000 years ago.:\\u200a55\\u200a Its use in Northern Europe for oil lamps is documented to the 13th century. Rapeseed oil extracts were first put on the market in 1956–1957 as food products, but these suffered from several unacceptable characteristics. That form of rapeseed oil had a distinctive taste and a greenish colour due to the presence of chlorophyll and still contained a higher concentration of erucic acid.\\nCanola was bred from rapeseed cultivars of B. napus and B. rapa at the University of Manitoba, Canada, by Keith Downey and Baldur R. Stefansson in the early 1970s, having then a different nutritional profile than present-day oil in addition to much less erucic acid. Canola was originally a trademark name of the Rapeseed Association of Canada; the name is a portmanteau of \"can\" from Canada and \"ola\" from \"oil\". Canola is now a generic term for edible varieties of rapeseed oil in North America and Australasia; the change in name also serves to distinguish it from natural rapeseed oil, which has much higher erucic acid content.\\nA genetically engineered rapeseed that is tolerant to the herbicide Roundup (glyphosate) was first introduced to Canada in 1995 (Roundup Ready). A genetically modified variety developed in 1998 is considered to be the most disease- and drought-resistant canola variety to date. In 2009, 90% of the Canadian crop was herbicide-tolerant. In 2005, 87% of the canola grown in the US was genetically modified. In 2011, out of the 31 million hectares of canola grown worldwide, 8.2 million (26%) were genetically modified.\\nA 2010 study conducted in North Dakota found glyphosate- or glufosinate-resistance transgenes in 80% of wild natural rapeseed plants, and a few plants that were resistant to both herbicides. This may reduce the effectiveness of the herbicide tolerance trait for weed control over time, as the weed species could also become tolerant to the herbicide. However, one of the researchers agrees that \"feral populations could have become established after trucks carrying cultivated GM seeds spilled some of their load during transportation\". She also notes that the GM canola results they found may have been biased as they only sampled along roadsides.\\nGenetically modified canola attracts a price pena'),\n",

Consequently, people with vascular dementia tend to perform worse than their Alzheimer's disease counterparts in frontal lobe tasks, such as verbal fluency, and may present with frontal lobe problems: apathy, abulia (lack of will or initiative), problems with attention, orientation, and urinary incontinence. They tend to exhibit more perseverative behavior. People with vascular dementia may also present with general slowing of processing ability, difficulty shifting sets, and impairment in abstract thinking. Apathy early in the disease is more suggestive of vascular dementia.\\nRare genetic disorders that cause vascular lesions in the brain have other presentation patterns. As a rule, they tend to occur earlier in life and have a more aggressive course. In addition, infectious disorders, such as syphilis, can cause arterial damage, strokes, and bacterial inflammation of the brain.\\n\\n\\n== Causes ==\\n\\nVascular dementia can be caused by ischemic or hemorrhagic infarcts affecting multiple brain areas, including the anterior cerebral artery territory, the parietal lobes, or the cingulate gyrus. On rare occasion, infarcts in the hippocampus or thalamus are the cause of dementia. A history of stroke increases the risk of developing dementia by around 70%, and recent stroke increases the risk by around 120%. Brain vascular lesions can also be the result of diffuse cerebrovascular disease, such as small vessel disease.\\n\\n\\n=== Risk factors ===\\n\\nRisk factors for vascular dementia include increasing age, hypertension, sm\")]"
